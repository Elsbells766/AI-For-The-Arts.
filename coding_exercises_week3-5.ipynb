    "- Printing the varibales, That python looks st the value stored in \"message\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Asking for more explanation:\n",
    "- I asked copilot to exapand on the prompt \"Explain f-strings in detail\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It response was \"f‑strings (formatted string literals) let you embed Python expressions directly inside string literals using curly braces {}. They’re concise, fast, and readable.\" it then went on to give varying code examples, regarding core syntax and behaviour. Basic interpolation (\"Anything inside { ... } is evaluated as a Python expression at runtime, converted to a string, and inserted.\"), Valid expression (\"You can access attributes, indexes, call functions, and perform calculations\"), Escaping braces(\"literal { or } in the output must be doubled\"). Furthermore it explained when note to use f-strings, it generated (\"When you need to translate strings or reuse format templates across languages (use placeholders that a translation system can handle).When you’re on Python < 3.6 (use str.format). When the format string itself is user‑provided and you need strict control or sanitization.\"). This was useful as it allowed me to gain a deeper understaning on F-strings and there purpose within variabes\n",

Going through the task I found the image part of the task simple to undertsand. However, when it came to the audio while the second audio playd as it should. Unformtunatly the first audio did not play. When discussing with peers this appeared to be a common issue. Overall, this task has helped me further my skills in python and has helped in the development of understanding code. \n",
