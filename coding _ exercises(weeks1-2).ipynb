    "# Weeks 1-2\n",
    "Prior to embarking on 12 weeks of tasks, to improve understanding on programming concepts. It was important to gain understaing on what code actually is. My understanding of code, is that it is like an umbrella term. Any type of code is made up of algorythims. An algorythim can be defined as a step-by-step process of completing a tasks or solving an issue. Algorithims can be displayed in human or computer language. While the idea of code can be intimidating for a beginner, once one has a grasp on fundamental functions it can become easier to read and understand. In starting to grasp concepts, pseudocode was useful. pseudocode can be defined as a simplified way of explaining what code should do and uses human language.\n",

    "The following notebooks display the use of python. Python is a universally popular coding language to do its accsesibility and through refelction of using it, I am able to understand why it is favoured over other coding languages."

    "### I began this project by navigating to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Learn about GitHub\n",
    "I begain by learing about GitHub, to help with this process I watched a Youtube video from Net Ninga(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjQznt-8kE). This explained some of the basics, i learned that GitHub is a space which allows both collabortation and version control. It is also useful as it allows users to track changes they have made to their project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 and 3 : Creating a GitHub account and learning about repositories\n",
    "I created an account and set out to learn about basic repositories. The \"Hello World!\" page was the first thing I read and was useful when gathering basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I created my repository called \"AI-FOR-THE-ARTS.\"\n",
    "- I made sure the tick the box for a READMEfile\n",
    "- I set an appropriate licence (MIT)\n",
    "- I created a branch called readme-edit\n",
    "- I sucsessfully created a pull reguest and merged work I put into my readme edit to my README file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Styling README\n",
    "- I next learned about the use of headings and how they differ from HTML. The website,(https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) explained headings can be created through hashtag symbols and through equals signs benath them.\n",
    "- I used the pencil icon to edit and update my README with relevant information.\n",
    "- Finally, once I was happy with it I made sure to commit my changes\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this work can all be displayed in my README file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5 and 6: Uploading and deleting content from repositories\n",
    "- I also learned how to upload and delete content from my repository. To upload, navigate to the \"add files\" button, selected the upolad files option, select files and then add a message when commiting changes. To delete, click on the file you want to delete, click the three dots, click on the delte file option, add a message before commiting the change.\n",
    "#### Step 7: Checking changes in repositories\n",
    "- Once everything was saved, I was able to navigate to my commits (this is where you can view the changes you have made). Furthermore, it highlights the importance of writing what you have changed while editing, to make specific changes easier to locate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "Reflecting on this first task, I found it hard to navigate particularly with the pull requested and merging it. However, after completing this task I feel more confident in my abilities. I learned about headings as well as how to upload and delete files. I aso learned about the importance of writting messages alogside commiting changes. Aditionally, I learned for best bractice, to use branches before uploading to the main. As mentioned, these tasks are displayed on the README page of this portfolio of work. "

    "# Introduction to GitHub Codespaces\n",
    "#### Step 1: What are GitHub codepaces?\n",
    "- GitHub codespaces are a cloud based code environment.\n",
    "- It runs through web browser\n",
    "- You need to commit and sync changes to view them in your GitHub repository\n",
    "- They are a prime space for coding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 and 3\n",
    "The next step I took was navigating to my repository, from that I located to the green code button and opened my codespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4 and 5\n",
    "Furthermore, I then created a Jupyter notebook by navigating to the explorer pannel (clicking newfile). I named this \"coding exercises(weeks1-2).ipynb\". I chose to include the \"weeks 1-2\" to help keep better track of my progress and to create a clear layout for the reader. The \".ipynb\" is the essential part of this file (this extention is requited for a Jupyter notebook file)\n",

Aditionally Copilot was helpful as it generated practice tasks users could benefit from if they were unsure in their understanding. To relect copilot was able to teach me about how the print function is a built in function and how it is efficient in seeing outputs. It taught me about the use of parentheses and how what you put inside then is what you want to show. Finally it taught me about a string and how they are a line of characters (that must have quotes surroundig them)\n",

    "### When reflecting on these tasks, I feel my understading of Copilots value in learning about the print() function has been useful. Prior to this, I knew Copilot would be knowledgable, however as I was unfamiliar with the application I was unsure if I would find it helpful in my learning. However, it provided me with detailed step-by step instructions that were easy to follow as well as helped me practice by generating me code to run, which has allowed me to reflect and learn about the print() function in python code. Overall these tasks have contributed to fufilling the aims I have regarding completion of this potfolio.\n",

    "Extra note: When coming back to edit and update this file, I had an error in syncing my work back with my Github. While in the past I would have been stressed, I reflected and thought about what was causing this, why it was happening, and the steps I nedded to take to fix it. I began by looking through the error messages to find it saying \"divergent error\". I consulted Copilot with my issue, it was able to generate multiple examles of things to try. After reading through I selected the option I felt would work the best and inserted it into my terminal to try and mitigate this syning error. It worked!. This further has aided in my understanding in troubleshooting an error, learning not to panic and to think logically about what the error message is saying. Aditionally, it has furthered my understanding of how Copilot can be used as an efficient tool in eliminating errors nd learning how to resolve basic coding errors."
