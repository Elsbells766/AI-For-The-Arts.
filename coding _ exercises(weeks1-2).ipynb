    "### I began this project by navigating to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Learn about GitHub\n",
    "I begain by learing about GitHub, to help with this process I watched a Youtube video from Net Ninga(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjQznt-8kE). This explained some of the basics, i learned that GitHub is a space which allows both collabortation and version control. It is also useful as it allows users to track changes they have made to their project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 and 3 : Creating a GitHub account and learning about repositories\n",
    "I created an account and set out to learn about basic repositories. The \"Hello World!\" page was the first thing I read and was useful when gathering basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I created my repository called \"AI-FOR-THE-ARTS.\"\n",
    "- I made sure the tick the box for a READMEfile\n",
    "- I set an appropriate licence (MIT)\n",
    "- I created a branch called readme-edit\n",
    "- I sucsessfully created a pull reguest and merged work I put into my readme edit to my README file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Styling README\n",
    "- I next learned about the use of headings and how they differ from HTML. The website,(https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) explained headings can be created through hashtag symbols and through equals signs benath them.\n",
    "- I used the pencil icon to edit and update my README with relevant information.\n",
    "- Finally, once I was happy with it I made sure to commit my changes\n",
    "#### Step 5 and 6: Uploading and deleting content from repositories\n",
    "- I also learned how to upload and delete content from my repository. To upload, navigate to the \"add files\" button, selected the upolad files option, select files and then add a message when commiting changes. To delete, click on the file you want to delete, click the three dots, click on the delte file option, add a message before commiting the change.\n",
    "#### Step 7: Checking changes in repositories\n",
    "- Once everything was saved, I was able to navigate to my commits (this is where you can view the changes you have made). Furthermore, it highlights the importance of writing what you have changed while editing, to make specific changes easier to locate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflection\n",
    "Reflecting on this first task, I found it hard to navigate particularly with the pull requested and merging it. However, after completing this task I feel more confident in my abilities. I learned about headings as well as how to upload and delete files. I aso learned about the importance of writting messages alogside commiting changes. Aditionally, I learned for best bractice, to use branches before uploading to the main.These tasks are displayed on the README page of this portfolio of work. "

    "# Introduction to GitHub Codespaces\n",
    "#### Step 1: What are GitHub codepaces?\n",
    "- GitHub codespaces are a cloud based code environment.\n",
    "- It runs through web browser\n",
    "- You need to commit and sync changes to view them in your GitHub repository\n",
    "- They are a prime space for coding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 and 3\n",
    "The next step I took was navigating to my repository, from that I located to code button and opened my codespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4 and 5\n",
    "Furthermore, I then created a Jupyter notebook by navigating to the explorer pannel (clicking newfile). I named this \"coding exercises(weeks1-2).ipynb\". I chose to include the \"weeks 1-2\" to help keep better track of my progress and for a clear layout. The \".ipynb\" is the essential part of this file ( this extention is requited for a Jupyter notebook file)\n",

    "\"print(...) — a built-in function\n",
    "What it is: print is a function that displays text or values on the screen.\n",
    "Why we use it: It’s the quickest way to see output and check what your program is doing.\n",

    "Meaning: The parentheses after print mean “call this function.”\n",
    "Inside the parentheses: You put what you want to show on screen (called the argument).\n",
    " \"Hello, world!\" — a string\n",
    "What it is: A string is a sequence of characters (letters, spaces, punctuation) surrounded by quotes.\n",
    "Quotes: You can use double quotes \" or single quotes '.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as this step-by-step guide, it also generated common mistakes of begginers such as missing quotes and mismatched quotes. It further generated code to highlight these mistakes. Aditionally Copilot was helpful as it generated practice tasks users could benefit from if they were unsure in their understanding. To relect copilot was able to teach me about how the print function is a built in function and how it is efficient in seeing outputs. It taught me about the use of parentheses and how what you put inside then is what you want to show. Finally it taught me about a string and how they are a line of characters (that must have quotes surroundig them)\n",
    "#### What I learned from this task:\n",
    "- I learnd how to run a basic python program \n",
    "- I learned about the purpose of print()\n",
    "- I learned about the importance of enclosing text (\"\",'') as it is written as a string\n",
