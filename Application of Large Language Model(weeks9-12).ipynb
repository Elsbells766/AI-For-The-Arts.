    "### Introduction and What is an LLM's:\n",
    "\n",
    "LMM’s are AI models that rely on vast amounts of training data (from books, websites, articles, human prompts) this helps them with pattern recognition and ulamitley helps them generate more accurate responses to users prompts and helps then to learn various social ques, us as humans use. They can be found as part of popular chatbots such as ChatGPT 4.0 and virtual assistants. They can provide fast text/image responses as well as are able to translate multiple languages and work with code. LLM’s aim to respond as a human would, generating text and in a conversational manor and by asking questions back to the user. Despite their advanced technology, they still do not compare to humans in terms of true understanding, instead they rely on prediction of patterns that they have learned through said training data. LLM’s commonly rely on neural networks within their structure. The parameters of this help eradicate errors. As mentioned, examples of where LLM’s can be found are ChatGPT (and other chatbots), T5 by google, llama, and Microsoft copilot (which has been used throughout this project) \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this piece of writing, I will be highlight how LLM’s can be used to advance care in information regarding mental health. I would like to preface the design of this model does not aim to replace therapy/ professional care but simply aims to act as a further resource for individuals to learn more about various mental health issues. AI can be used to provide 24/7 support and aid in answering questions to support users who are going through a tough time (or are just curious!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### My official LLM Proposal:\n",
    "\n",
    "I am proposing an LLM that will be able to provide fast and nurturing responses to questions users have regarding mental health topics (such as anxiety and depression) and will focus on letting individuals reflect upon their personal situations, by programming the model to as reflective questions. Furthermore, it will provide resources to professional places to seek help if prompts from the user become alarming (or the user asks for them).  This LLM should consider the types of tone and phrases used for responses. (Many individuals who are concerned over health issues in general and may be anxious) By integrating empathetic Reponses into this model, it will be able to accommodate for all users. In order to run, my LLM will need to use vast amounts of training data form health websites and organisations to accumulate facts and knowledge on these different topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it could augment learning and enhance inclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical analysis of my LLM (and solutions):\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the topic, mental health can accumulate a lot of sensitive information. To aid in mitigating these concerns (regarding privacy and to consider ethical concerns), using LLMs such as llama or ollama would be suitable. This would mean users could keep track of their data as it would be on their local devices. This would be a better fit as opposed to something such as ChatGPT 4, where users are unsure of where their data is going. Furthermore, there may be issues regarding, misinformation being spread due to accidental biases in training data. This is something that is difficult to fully get rid of, however providing a warning/disclaimer could be a good way to remind users that they should speak to a professional if unsure of a response. My LLM could have both social and cultural benefits too. It could help reduce stigma around mental health, particularly for men as men's mental health often attracts criticism*. A well as this it could help voice basic coping mechanisms and provide information for those who are just simply curious about the topic. This would mean more individuals in society would be educated. Furthermore, it could direct those who need further help to professionals, meaning people who are struggling would have a higher chance of being taken care of properly. Finally, it could also be used as a way to promote the use of safe and ethical use of AI. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Peer group review\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon discussion with my lab group, we disscued our different approaches to this task and shared our different ideas for LLM applications. Through this, we unanimously agreed upon the importance of LLM’s in various areas such as cultural heritage, which members of my group decided to revolve there models around. However, because my topic has the potential to carry more sensitive data, I could also acknowledge potential risks (regarding privacy and ethical concerns). Peer feedback was useful in consolidating my idea as it allowed for different perspectives. Furthermore, my peers gave positive feedback on my LLM model using llama or ollama for data privacy reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion of my LLM project:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project highlights my design of a mental health awareness model using LLM. My design highlights both the benefits as well as considerations needed to be taken when creating a LLM for this kind of topic.\n",

    "## Final reflection on this portfolio:\n",
    "Upon reflection of all the tasks I have completed, they have all been useful in fulfilling the aims I had when embarking on this portfolio. Weeks 1-2 helped give me a solid background of context on GitHub, python and how copilot could be used in helping understand code. When referring back to my aims, I have now successfully created an organised portfolio to display my work. Furthermore, I am now able to understand and use basic functions of GitHub. When reflecting upon python code and understanding basic coding concepts, this was the area I was least confident about due to my lack of experience with code. However, due to the help of Copilot I was able to complete these tasks and fulfil these aims. This project has taught me a lot about how copilot can be used in a way to enhance learning, its responses were clear and helpful. Additionally, when I struggled to understand certain aspects, I was able to further interrogate copilot until I understood. These tasks have aided in my understanding an ability to read code and identify errors as well as given me the tools to critically analyse work I have done. Furthermore, discussions with peers was useful, comparing and explaining to one another what we had learnt helped to further develop my knowledge. In wees 6-8 I was able to.Finally, the last task I completed was useful and interesting. I enjoyed the creative freedom we were allowed when completing this task as well as how it allowed for even further consolidation of literature and resources I read. Overall, while some elements of this portfolio I found challenging, it has ultimately given me a deeper understanding of GitHub, Python code, code spaces, Copilot and LLMs. As well as provided me with skills that can be transferred in projects in the future. \n"
